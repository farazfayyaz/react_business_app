# react_business_app
A web app built with React.js to mimic an online business card.


This project was the first project I had created using React.js which came from the Scrimba course.

The ideas was to create a business card in a web app where you are linking your professional pages and information. In a way, it is a very simplified LinkedIn.

It was a while since I had used CSS and I was learning how to use vaniall CSS practically again.

This is an old project that may need to be revisited soon, but I definetly wanted to showcase this on my page.
